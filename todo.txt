critters should be on top of everything
critters should also be possible (= they have to be) discardable during the cleanup phase, same rules apply like to the photos
restart is currently not working properly, often crashing the game - Trying to assign invalid previously freed instance. happens for "var slot : Node2D = _mem2slot.get(mem_id)"
animace circles - možná místo zaostřování/zvětšování by mohla být animace jak se mění z pekne boruvky na skaredou
hudba
zvuk zaostřování (možná každé kolco jiný zvuk, zvuky se doplňují)
dialogue: Change every single font color, type, size etc. so that the game looks better
After going through all snapped photos and critters dialogues, stage 2 should trigger, but that does not happen. The issue likely is  likely either in Photo.gd, stagecontroller or kind wherever it makes sense
Critters should be on a higher layer than the dialogue visual and above circles (blueberries)
